libjson
=======

Super simple C JSON implementation, designed to work on IRIX 6.5, as part of my
Motif Matrix client project.

libjson requires *lemon* to generate the JSON parsing code (json\_decode()).

*cmocka* is needed if you want to run the unit tests.

Note that the Makefile is in the BSD/smake format, NOT GNU.
